<h1 align="center">404 Page not found</h1>

### *BUT!*

You probably meant to download plugins, but linking to the route won't work, if you go to the [website](https://pbp-store.github.io) 
then click the button, it will work. Don't ask my why, svelte-navigator does some black magic

If you weren't meaning to go to the plugins page (and not the about page)...

Why did you try to go to this route?
